# DotRing

Creates 1-5 black rings located in the center, like a dart target
Randomly adds grey-black 15-25 dots that will be part of the dotring image
Uses an autoencoder to seperate the manually generated images into pure dot and ring images (trained 100)
Displays the images

Issues:
RAM overload
